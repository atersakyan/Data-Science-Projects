# Customer Segmentation with RFM

#### Project Overview and Problem Statement(s):

How can we efficiently target customers? 

With any business each customer is different and has different needs and patterns. The goal of this project was to look at customer purchasing behavior, segment them, and see how we can use the information to target them efficiently and effectively. Further, once customers were segmented, time series models were used to predict revenue for each customer cluster. 

#### The Data and Models:
The data: E-commerce data from a UK-based retailer.

The models: Cohort analysis, RFM analysis, clustering, and time series models were used to address the problem statements.
