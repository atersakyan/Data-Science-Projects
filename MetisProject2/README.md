# AirBnb Price Predictions

#### Project Overview and Problem Statement(s):
What predicts AirBnb rental price?

This project focused on uncovering predictors of AirBnb rental prices in New York City. Examining these predictors can provide interesting insights that can benefit a host looking to maximize their profits. To dive deeper into the possible factors that contribute to AirBnb rental prices, I used various linear regression models with Scikit-Learn and StatsModels in Python.

#### The Data and Models:
The data: Kaggle dataset of ~74k Airbnb rentals. The dataset includes many features such as: Number of beds, number of guests allowed, description, number of reviews, and many more. For a more detailed preview into the features and the data, see the dataset here.

The models: This question falls into the category of regression and prediction, so linear regression models were used. I used StatsModels to generate a starting point Ordinary Least Squares model, and Scikit-Learn to generate LassoCV and RidgeCV models.
