# Classification of Marketing Campaign Success
#### Project Overview and Problem Statement(s):

How can a company precisely target customers to increase revenue?

In this project I examined data from a previous marketing campaigns to try to better target customers in the future. Exploring previous customer behavior can provide insights that aid in predicting and influencing future behavior, and improve capture rate (recall) of campaigns. Finally, with the insights from the models, I made suggestions on how the company could improve in future campaigns. See presentation [here](https://github.com/atersakyan/Projects/blob/master/MetisProject3/Metis%20Project%203-%20Marketing%20Classification.pdf).

#### The data and models:
The data: Marketing data from an e-commerce company that sells food and wine. The dataset includes sales data and demographic features about each customer.

The models: Used various classification models (KNN, Naive Bayes, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression), then fine tuned top performing models. Final model used was XGBoost.
